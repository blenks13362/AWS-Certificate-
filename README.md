About This Repository

This repo is my personal learning journal as I prepare for the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** exam. I'm documenting everything that helps me — summaries, notes, hands-on projects, exam tips, and links to useful resources.

The idea is to build a solid foundation, not just pass the exam. If you're also on this path, feel free to fork, use, or suggest improvements.
